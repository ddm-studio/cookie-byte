# Cookie Byte

[![Statamic 3.0+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statamic-3.0%2B-FF269E)](https://statamic.com/)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ddm-studio/cookie-byte.svg)](https://gitHub.com/ddm-studio/cookie-byte/releases/)

> Cookie Byte is an important keystone addon for your website to comply with
> modern cookie policies. Next to a modal it features a whole bunch of other
> features to make you stop worrying about cookies.

## Features

* **Control panel settings:** Change settings right from where you like it most:
  The control panel. Enable the addon, add cookies classes, remove a snippet -
  Here you can try your hand at being god.
* **Usability & GDPR-compliant:** Any snippet will only be added as soon as the
  user consents the required cookies - with no page reload needed.
* **Cookie Covers:** Some content needs to be hidden as long as cookies haven't
  been accepted, like Google Maps. For these reasons we added Cookie Covers.
* **Customisability:** The modal and the covers are completely customizable -
  change every text or just the position of the modal, however you like it.
* **Developer-friendly:** By default, we add pre-defined styles and inline code
  to make your life easier. But if you want more control, you can customize both.

...and there are more amazing features to find or already on our [TODO list](README.md#in-a-future-release)

## Documentation

For more information about how to use this addon see our
[documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Licensing

You can use the addon for free during development as long as you want, to see if
it suits you and your website. As soon as you fell in love with it and want to
put it on your live production site, the addon needs licensing. Check out the
[Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/addons/statamic/seo-pro)  to learn
more about the that.

## In a future release...

...you will see more awesome features like:

* **Another modal type:** We'll add a more sophisticated modal to choose from,
  which features submenus and a harder opt-out passage - for our more analytical
  and marketing users.
* **Consent records:** How many people have seen the modal? How many have
  accepted? And how many have bounced off? You'll find out here.
* **Geo-Targeting:** Choose from a range of countries that need the cookie modal
  in the first place. By default, all EU countries will be selected.
